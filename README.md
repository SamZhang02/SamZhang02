# Hi, my name is Sam Zhang.

I am presently in pursuit of a Bachelor's of Arts in Computer Science and Statistics at McGill University in Montreal, Canada.

My current areas of interest are:
- Backend Development
- Machine Learning

I am currently interning at [Meituan](https://about.meituan.com/) as a Machine Learning Engineer in Shanghai, China, working on optimizing one of the Dianping app's recommendation system's model.

I will be interning remotely at [Ceridian](https://www.ceridian.com/) as a Fullstack Software Developer this fall and winter, with the team located in Toronto, Canada.
